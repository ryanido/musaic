# Musaic
Musaic is a music recommendation application that uses the Spotify API to recommend artists, songs, and albums to users based on their listening history.

## Current Status
The user interface for Musaic is currently operational, and I have successfully connected to the Spotify API. Users are able to browse recommendations.

## Next Steps
My next step is to focus on improving the user interface and user experience of Musaic. This includes adding additional screens,features and functionality, as well as fine-tuning the layout and design of the app.

I will also be working on providing analytics and insights into the users' listening experiences, such as their most listened to artists and songs, and the genres and moods they tend to prefer. This will allow us to better understand the preferences and tastes of our users and provide even more personalized recommendations.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and improve Musaic!
